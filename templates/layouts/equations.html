    <b><p style="text-align:left">SIR Differential Equations</p></b>
    <p>$${dS \over dt} = {-\beta SI}$$</p>
    <p>$${dI \over dt} = {\beta SI - \gamma I}$$</p>
    <p>$${dR \over dt} = {\gamma I}$$</p>

    <p style="text-align:left">The three primary equations used to calculate the SIR models. S is the population number that are currently susceptible to infection. I is the count of population that are currently infectious (symptoms or no symptoms). R is the population count that are removed from infectiousness and no longer susceptible. So those that have recovered...or not.</p>

        <b><p>Randomized Data</p></b>
        <p>In many machine learning applications it is necessary to create test data for training and assessment of models. In the Analytics section you will find my self written program used to do just this. This particular program is taylored towards logistic regression so the outcome is either true or false. The current inputs are percentage of positive outcomes (true), maximum age, number of records, and proportion of gender, subdivided by positive or negative status.  </p>
